# Project
I had this idea for this project

the difference between $1 and $2 is 100%, but from 2 to 3 is only 50%, there is a diminishing return to increases
This means that having a narrowly distributed income clustered lower gains each person more in marginal gains
wider spread distributions have smaller marginal gains

Theres also comparing incomes within the distributions

Do prices follow the median income? The average?
