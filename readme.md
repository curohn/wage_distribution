# Wage Distribution - In Progress

## Project Overview
Project aims at measuring the differences in the distributions of earnings year over year. The dataset is S1901 "INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2020 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS)" from the US Census Bureau. 

Currently, this project plots the year distributions in a ridgeline plot, to show the different buckets over time. I'd like to expand to measuring the difference in distributions, as well as the spread in the distributions.
